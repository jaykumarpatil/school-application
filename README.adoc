== Test the Application

Test the end-to-end result by starting the application. You can start the application in
your IDE or use the command line. Once the application is running, visit the client
application in the browser, at `http://localhost:8080/`. There, you should see
`Hello, World` reflected in the response.

If you use Gradle, the following command (really two commands run in sequence) will first
build the library and then run the application:

====
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build && ./gradlew :application:bootRun
----
====

If you use Maven, the following command (really two commands run in sequence) will first
build the library and then run the application:

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw install && ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl application
